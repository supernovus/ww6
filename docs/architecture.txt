ww6 Architecture
-----------------

So, what are all those files in the lib directory? Well, let's find out.

=== Webtoo.pm ===

The core ww6 engine. This is what makes it tick.

In your application, you will create a Webtoo object for each
page request. If you are using SCGI, this is done in the handler subroutine.

Webtoo is capable of loading plugins, either statically or dyanmically.
It is also capable of loading metadata from any Perlite::Data compatible
object (such as Perlite::Data::JSON or Perlite::Data::YAML).

=== Websight.pm ===

A role that is meant for loadable plugins.

=== Websight/ ===

All of the classes in this folder are loadable plugins, and all use
the Websight role.

These plugins are designed to allow for a custom content management
system, but are also good examples to use when planning on writing your
own plugins.

=== WW/ ===

This directory contains roles for use with Websight plugins and/or
Websight::Lighter Controllers, Plugins, and Models.
