ww6 Architecture
-----------------

So, what are all those files in the lib directory? Well, let's find out.

=== Webtoo.pm ===

The core ww6 engine. This is what makes it tick.

In your application, you will create a Webtoo object for each
page request. If you are using SCGI, this is done in the handler subroutine.

=== Webtoo/ ===

Plugins that directly extend the functionality of Webtoo.
These are designed as Perl 6 Roles, that you must apply to your
Webtoo object using the 'does' statement.

Once added, your Webtoo object will have new capabilities.

 = Webtoo/Plugins.pm =

This Role will add the ability to load plugins. You can load plugins either
dynamically (pass the class name) or statically (pass an object of a given
class.)

NOTE: Until Rakudo implements a proper 'require' statement, the dynamic
loading does not work properly.

 = Webtoo/Metadata/PDDL.pm =

This Role adds a Perlite::Data object as $.metadata.
Perlite Data Definition Language is slightly similar to YAML, but was
designed specifically for use with an older version of ww6.
I am looking at adding a new Metadata role that will be able to use standard
serialization languages such as YAML, JSON or PSON (Perl Six Object Notation).
That's not quite ready yet though, as I have to figure out how it will handle
rules for merging data.

=== Websight.pm ===

A role that is meant for loadable plugins.

=== Websight/ ===

All of the classes in this folder are loadable plugins, meant for use
with the Webtoo::Plugins functionality. They all use the Websight role.
