- Completely refactor how Caching works. 
  x Rip the Cache generation code out of Content.
  x Change Content so it no longer has cache-ext and page-ext, only extension.
  x This means flags like 'cache-only' and 'use-cache: 2' are now obsolete.
  xxx   The above bits are done, the following items aren't though.
  - Write a new Cache plugin that actually generates the cache files.
    This will probably be a lot more complex than the previous method.
    We may pull in perl6-File-Utils as a new dependency.
  - Now to use the cache, have a plugin "Content=cache" with settings like:
    "cache" : { "cache" : 1, "extension" : ".cache" },
  - You can use "no-content" conditions if the Cache failed.
    For instance a plugin spec: "Dispatch+cache"
    "dispatch-cache" : [ { "no-content" : 1, "set" : 
      { "~plugins" : ["Content"] } } ],
  - Caching becomes more complex, but also becomes more flexible and
    applies to non-Content paths (such as Lighter paths, or other plugins.)
  - Oh, make sure Cache plugin uses $.parent.metadata.request.path to
    generate the cache file, and not $.parent.path, as the latter can be
    overridden using URI Rewriting, and we want to cache the real requests.

- Finish porting Index::Update to the new infrastructure.

- Replicate the functionality of the Linkage and Gallery plugins from ww5.

- Make this use a proper resources folder once Module::Install and proto/pls
  support it, rather than maintaining a custom Makefile.

- Port the Page Editor and Data Editor from ww5.
- Port the File Manager from ww5.
