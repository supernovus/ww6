- Make Content and Lighter both support "fallthrough" mode, in which they
  will not handle last-level 'page not found', but instead return to Plugin
  processing without setting content.

- Make a Conditional plugin, that see's if $.parent.content has been set,
  and if it has, add a specific set of metadata (including plugins.)
  If it hasn't, add a different set of metadata (including plugins.)

- Make a Rewriting ability in the Dispatch plugin, similar to the 
  URI Routing in CodeIgniter. In this case, Rewriting would work with 
  any other paths, which means not just Lighter apps, but CMS pages and 
  paths dispatched to standalone plugins.

- Change how caching works with headers, and enable a separate rootdir 
  for static site generation.

- Finish porting Index::Update to the new infrastructure.

- Make this use a proper resources folder once Module::Install and proto/pls
  support it, rather than maintaining a custom Makefile.

- Replicate the functionality of the Linkage and Gallery plugins from ww5.
- Port the Page Editor and Data Editor from ww5.
- Port the File Manager from ww5.
