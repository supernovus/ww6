This is an example that shows off a lot of functionality.
It's not an example of best practices with ww6.
I am planning to add a new template called 'default' that
is very similar to this example, but instead uses more sane defaults
(basically, using the defaults from 'webapp' and 'website', but in a
 complex configuration.)

So, with all that said, this is a good example to see the feature set,
but it's not a good example to base your website/application off of.
