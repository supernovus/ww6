Webtoo Websight 6 is the next generation of the content
management system that powers my websites. 
</p>
</div>
<p>
Webtoo Websight has gone through many rewrites since it's humble orgins
ten years ago. Originally, there was a collection of Perl 5 CGI scripts.
They had no way of working together, and often had duplicated functionality.
The first version of Webtoo Websight was an attempt to bring them together
in a framework. Unfortunately, it was overly complex, and didn't really
work very well.
</p>
<p>
The second version was a rewrite, simplifying the system, and making it
far easier to extend. This was the first version I used on my websites.
Versions 3 and 4 were both partial rewrites, extending
a lot of core functionality, while still using a lot of the same code.
</p>
<p>
Version 5 was a complete rewrite, moving to Object Oriented Perl 5, and
offering the greatest flexibility of any version. However, over a couple
of years, much of the functionality was changed, and the codebase became
nearly unmaintainable.
</p>
<p>
I considered a rewrite using Moose and other new Perl 5 technologies.
But that would mean rewriting a lot of my Perlite libraries as well.
</p>
<p>
So, when it came time to write ww6, I rewrote the whole thing, from scratch,
in Perl 6.
</p>
<p>
So, ww6 can serve the same page styles as ww5, but in slightly different
ways. It has less plugins than the previous version, but a lot of the
functionality from the older version is available in new ways.
</p>
<p>
The one place where ww6 is not complete compared to ww5, is web based
administration. There is currently no authentication system, and no
page or data editors, so everything must be done using the raw files.
Which isn't a problem for me, but if I was going to offer ww6 for other
people to use, I'd want to make a Simple Page Editor, Data Editor,
and the good old File Manager (of which a file manager was the first web
app I ever wrote, and there's been a file manager in every version of
Webtoo Websight.)
