Webtoo Websight 6 is the next generation of the content
management system that powers my websites. 
</p>
<p>
Webtoo Websight has gone through many rewrites since it's humble orgins
ten years ago. Originally, there was a collection of Perl 5 CGI scripts.
They had no way of working together, and often had duplicated functionality.
The first version of Webtoo Websight was an attempt to bring them together
in a framework. Unfortunately, it was overly complex, and didn't really
work very well.
</p>
<p>
The second version was a rewrite, simplifying the system, and making it
far easier to extend. This was the first version I used on my websites.
Versions 3 and 4 were both partial rewrites, extending
a lot of core functionality, while still using a lot of the same code.
</p>
<p>
Version 5 was a complete rewrite, moving to Object Oriented Perl 5, and
offering the greatest flexibility of any version. However, over a couple
of years, much of the functionality was changed, and the codebase became
nearly unmaintainable.
</p>
<p>
I considered a rewrite using Moose and other new Perl 5 technologies.
But that would mean rewriting a lot of my Perlite libraries as well.
</p>
<p>
So, when it came time to write ww6, I rewrote the whole thing, from scratch,
in Perl 6.
