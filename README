ww6: Web Application Framework and CMS Library-set for Perl 6

Status: It works, but depending on features you use, can be pretty slow.
        The dynamic module loading can have some strange side effects if
        you are mixing pre-compiled libraries with plain .pm ones.
        I recommend compiling everything first.
       
=== Story ===

In the beginning was Webtoo Websight, and it was good.
Based on the Perlite libraries it was, and they were good.

Both had reached a mighty version number of 5, but both had also
reached a point where a complete rewrite was in order.

It could have been done in Perl 5, as both were already written in
said language. It could have been done with magical tools such as
Moose, to make it stronger and easier to debug.

But then, the Great Architect said, "no."

And proceeded to rewrite the whole thing, in Perl 6.

This is the result.

=== Dependencies ===

 = Requirements =

- Rakudo Perl 6
  http://rakudo.org/
  A version of Perl 6 for the Parrot Virtual Machine.

- The Perlite library collection for Perl 6
  http://github.com/supernovus/perlite6
  This library collection was once included with ww6, but has been separated
  out for use in other projects.

- The Hash::Has, HashConfig and WebRequest libraries
  http://github.com/supernovus/hash-has
  http://github.com/supernovus/HashConfig
  http://github.com/supernovus/WebRequest
  Used by the core, these used to be part of Perlite, but
  where separated out into their own projects.

- The SCGI library for Perl 6
  http://github.com/supernovus/SCGI
  This library was written specifically because I was frustrated testing
  ww6 as a CGI script, where the performance was abysmal.
 
- The Exemel and Flower libraries
  http://github.com/supernovus/exemel
  http://github.com/supernovus/flower
  Not required by the Webtoo core, or the Example plugin,
  but these is used by the Websight CMS plugins.

- The JSON::Tiny library
  http://github.com/moritz/json
  Again, not used by the Webtoo core directly, but if you want to use
  the metadata functionality of Webtoo (required by most Websight plugins)
  then the currently supported metadata plugin is Perlite::Data::JSON.
  All example data files included with ww6 are written in JSON, using the
  Perlite::Data API for merge rules and includes.

- The Temporal Utils library collection
  http://github.com/supernovus/temporal-utils
  Not used by the core or Example plugin, but it is used by a few of the
  CMS plugins (including Headers) and by Flower::Utils::Date which can be
  loaded by the Petal plugin (see the utils option in the Petal plugin.)

- If you want to run the SCGI process on a computer behind NAT,
  and have the publically accessible web server forward requests
  to it, you can look into the reverse proxy functionality of OpenSSH.
  The 'service.sh' included shows how I have it set up to run on my home
  computer, and forward to my publically accessible VPS.

=== Future Plans ===

This project is still under construction, and does not include all of the
functionality from Webtoo Websight 5 yet.

In fact, it's currently in a major rewrite stage and does not even include
most of the functionality of the previous master version (the old-libs
folder contains a bunch of plugins that were written for the original ww6.)

In addition to the original 'dynamic website' content management system,
I would like to add the ability to create completely static websites using
templates (the static cache functionality from the previous ww6 design was
a similar idea, and may return, but I want to take it a bit further.)

See the docs/TODO.txt for more details on specific future plans.
