ww6: Web Application Framework for Perl 6

=== Story ===

In the beginning was Webtoo Websight, and it was good.
Based on the Perlite libraries it was, and they were good.

Both had reached a mighty version number of 5, but both had also
reached a point where a complete rewrite was in order.

It could have been done in Perl 5, as both were already written in
said language. It could have been done with magical tools such as
Moose, to make it stronger and easier to debug.

But then, the Great Architect said, "no."

And proceeded to rewrite the whole thing, in Perl 6/

This is the result.

=== Dependencies ===

 = Requirements =

- The January 2010 release of Rakudo Perl 6.
  This WILL NOT work with newer releases (yet) as they are based on a new
  core that has not finished adding the functionality from the previous
  core. I expect that by April 2010, the new core will have not only
  caught up to the old one, but have far surpassed it. Stay tuned!

 = Recommended =

- The SCGI library for Perl 6
  http://github.com/supernovus/SCGI
  This library was written specifically because I was frustrated testing
  ww6 as a CGI script, where the performance was abysmal.
  This is HIGHLY recommended, as using Perl 6 with plain CGI is unbearable.

=== Technical Details ===

 = WTDL =

The data definition language (WTDL) may at first glimse look like YAML,
but it is most certainly NOT. It has many significant differences, and is
currently highly specific to ww6. It may be possible to make it a standalone
library, but I don't see the point right now.

 = WTML =

Even more specialized is the template markup language (WTML) which is
based off of the WTML from Webtoo Websight 5, but now offers two syntax
formats, and the ability to plug in more.

 - WTML::Classic is most based on the syntax as used by ww5, but with a few
   changes for internal consistency. It is not XML compliant.
   <a.replacement.tag/>       (was <a.replacement.tag> in ww5)
   <nested.tag>
     <nested.tag.example/>
   </nested.tag>             (was <recurse "nested.tag"> in ww5)
   <if some.key = "value">
     Show this text
   <else/>                   ( the closing slash is optional. )
     Show this instead
   </if>                     ( =, !=, gt, lt, gt=, lt= are comparisons.)

 - WTML::Petal is based on the Perl 5 "Petal" markup language.

=== Not yet finished ===

This project is still under construction, and does not include all of the
functionality from Webtoo Websight 5 yet.

Hopefully it will soon exceed the older version.
