ww6: Web Application Framework for Perl 6

=== Story ===

In the beginning was Webtoo Websight, and it was good.
Based on the Perlite libraries it was, and they were good.

Both had reached a mighty version number of 5, but both had also
reached a point where a complete rewrite was in order.

It could have been done in Perl 5, as both were already written in
said language. It could have been done with magical tools such as
Moose, to make it stronger and easier to debug.

But then, the Great Architect said, "no."

And proceeded to rewrite the whole thing, in Perl 6.

This is the result.

=== Dependencies ===

 = Requirements =

- Rakudo Perl 6
  http://rakudo.org/
  A version of Perl 6 for the Parrot Virtual Machine.

- The Perlite libraries for Perl 6
  http://github.com/supernovus/perlite6
  This library collection was once included with ww6, but has been separated
  out for use in other projects.

- The SCGI library for Perl 6
  http://github.com/supernovus/SCGI
  This library was written specifically because I was frustrated testing
  ww6 as a CGI script, where the performance was abysmal.

- If you want to run the SCGI process on a computer behind NAT,
  and have the publically accessible web server forward requests
  to it, you can look into the reverse proxy functionality of OpenSSH.
  The 'service.sh' included shows how I have it set up to run on my home
  computer, and forward to my publically accessible VPS.
 
=== Future Plans ===

This project is still under construction, and does not include all of the
functionality from Webtoo Websight 5 yet.

In fact, it's currently in a major rewrite stage and does not even include
most of the functionality of the previous master version (the old-libs
folder contains a bunch of plugins that were written for the original ww6.)

In addition to the original 'dynamic website' content management system,
I would like to add the ability to create completely static websites using
templates (the static cache functionality from the previous ww6 design was
a similar idea, and may return, but I want to take it a bit further.)

See the docs/TODO.txt for more details on specific future plans.
