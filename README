ww6: Web Application Framework and CMS Library-set for Perl 6

Status: It works, but depending on features you use, can be pretty slow.
        The dynamic module loading can have some strange side effects if
        you are mixing pre-compiled libraries with plain .pm ones.
        I recommend compiling everything first, if you use 'neutro' as
        recommended below this will be done for you automatically.

NOTE:   This now has it's own custom Makefile, that was originally created
        by 'ufo' but is now manually managed. The reason is, I have a folder
        that needs to be installed into a location findable by the 'ww6'
        script, and until there is a library to use XDG folders on Unix and
        common folders on Windows, and it gets integrated with neutro, pls
        and proto, the custom Makefile will have to do.
        DO NOT run 'ufo' in this folder.

NOTE 2: This has only been tested on Linux, and due to using Makefiles and
        GNU-style options like 'cp -a', it may not work on any other OS.
        Feel free to try it with Cygwin or on MacOSX, and if are able to
        patch it up and make it work, send me the patch and you'll get listed
        in the credits.

=== Story ===

In the beginning was Webtoo Websight, and it was good.
Based on the Perlite libraries it was, and they were good.

Both had reached a mighty version number of 5, but both had also
reached a point where a complete rewrite was in order.

It could have been done in Perl 5, as both were already written in
said language. It could have been done with magical tools such as
Moose, to make it stronger and easier to debug.

But then, the Great Architect said, "no."

And proceeded to rewrite the whole thing, in Perl 6.

This is the result.

=== Dependencies ===

 = Requirements =

- Rakudo Perl 6
  http://rakudo.org/
  A version of Perl 6 for the Parrot Virtual Machine.

- The Perlite library collection for Perl 6
  http://github.com/supernovus/perlite6
  This library collection was once included with ww6, but has been separated
  out for use in other projects.

- The Hash::Has, HashConfig and WebRequest libraries
  http://github.com/supernovus/hash-has
  http://github.com/supernovus/HashConfig
  http://github.com/supernovus/WebRequest
  Used by the core, these used to be part of Perlite, but
  where separated out into their own projects.

- The SCGI library for Perl 6
  http://github.com/supernovus/SCGI
  This library was written specifically because I was frustrated testing
  ww6 as a CGI script, where the performance was abysmal.
 
- The Exemel and Flower libraries
  http://github.com/supernovus/exemel
  http://github.com/supernovus/flower
  Not required by the Webtoo core, but these are used by the 
  Websight CMS plugins.

- The JSON::Tiny library
  http://github.com/moritz/json
  Required by the HashConfig library, this is used for configuration
  files and Metadata in the CMS libraries.

- The Temporal Utils library collection
  http://github.com/supernovus/temporal-utils
  Not used by the core or Example plugin, but it is used by a few of the
  CMS plugins (including Headers) and by Flower::Utils::Date which can be
  loaded by the Petal plugin (see the utils option in the Petal plugin.)

- If you want to run the SCGI process on a computer behind NAT,
  and have the publically accessible web server forward requests
  to it, you can look into the reverse proxy functionality of OpenSSH.
  The 'service.sh' included shows how I have it set up to run on my home
  computer, and forward to my publically accessible VPS.

=== Future Plans ===

This project is still under construction, and does not include all of the
functionality from Webtoo Websight 5 yet.

In addition to the original 'dynamic website' content management system,
I would like to add the ability to create completely static websites using
templates (the static cache functionality from the previous ww6 design was
a similar idea, and may return, but I want to take it a bit further.)

See the docs/TODO.txt for more details on specific future plans.
